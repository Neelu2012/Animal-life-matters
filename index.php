             <h1>MAN HAS STOLEN THE EARTH TO FREE LINVING ANIMALS</h1>
             <p> 10,000 years ago, wild animals constituted 99% of biomass, and humans only 1%.Today, humans and the
                 animals that we raise and that we own as a commodity constitute 98% of the biomass, and wild animals
                 only 2%.We have stolen all the Earth from all free living animals, to use for ourselves and for all our
                 cows, pigs, poultry, and farm fishes, and the oceans have been even more devastated. Growing needs of
                 farm land for animal husbandry provoke wild horses capture,and the slaughter of wolfes, linx, coyotes,
                 hyenas, and other predators. <br>
                 <br>
                 The UN and other agencies declared that not only animal husbandry plays a major role in climate change,
                 but that it is also the leading cause of resources consumption and environmental destruction, who plague
                 the planet every day. Researchers agree on the fact that the primary cause of loss of species is due to
                 overgrazing, livestock production and over fishing. We are in the middle of the largest mass instinction
                 of species in 65 million years.For Allan Savory, almost 1/3rd of the surface of the Earth is turning
                 into desert, and a large part is due to livestock production. But in order to solve the problem, he
                 advises to eat more animals grown in a "sustainable" way", just as Oceana advises to eat more
                 "sustainable" fish to protect fishes... And then the best way to protect pandas, is to eat pandas?

             <h1>MEAT COSTS MORE AND EVERYBODY PAYS</h1>
             <p>
                 Externalized costs of meat production are not taken into account by producers. They are imposed onto
                 society: health impacts, environmental damages, federal subsidies, fisheries devastations, and
                 incredible cruelty toward the animals. The total estimated cost is 414 billion dollars. If the meat and
                 dairy industries were forced to internalize these costs, to pay for the damages they cause, the price of
                 meat and milk would skyrocket: a $5 box of eggs would be $13, and a $4 bigmac would be $11. Regardless
                 if you choose to be vegan, vegetarian, or meat eater, we all pay for the meat consumption of someone
                 else.
                 Everytime someone buys a $4 bigmac somewhere, the whole society pays $7.

             <h1>LET'S END THE MASSACRE</h1>
             <br></br>
             <p>
                 Stop eating animals and their products: no other change of behavior has a greater positive impact on the
                 planet, and on every lives on this planet.75% of Americans consider themselves to be environmentalists.
                 To solve the problem of the environment in a heartbeat, all we would need is that these
                 "environmentalists" live what they profess, and the world will change.Until we stop overgrazing and
                 animal agriculture, we will not be able to save the ecosystem, and to have enough food for everyone on
                 the planet. We will not stop climate change, we will not stop pollution and "dead zones" expansion, and
                 we will not stop the slaughter of sharks, wolves, and of the other predators.The only sustainable way of
                 living with 7 billion people on the planet is a vegan diet. Stop eating others, eat for others.</p>

             <h1>ANIMALS ARE SENSITIVE BEINGS</h1>
             <p>
                 What do I mean by that Simply that animals feel pain and are capable of emotions. Just as we humans hurt
                 when we break a leg we inadvertently cut ourselves off or are afraid if someone armed threatens us.
                 Except that we do not just mistreat them we kill them on a large scale.
                 Then of course animals may not have the same developed awareness and intelligence as human beings But in
                 the name of what does it justify to make them suffer or kill them Especially since being so-called less
                 intelligent does not prevent you from suffering or being afraid
